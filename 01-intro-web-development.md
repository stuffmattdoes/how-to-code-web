# 1. Intro to Web Development
Welcome to your first lesson! If you're still here, you're still curious. Great! In this lesson, I will expand your curiousity by defining what web development is, why you'd want to do it, and what kind of career you can make out of it.

## What is it?
To start, let's define some terms. ***"Web development"*** can be roughly defined as ***someone who makes applications for the internet***. This is quite a general phrase, so let's further break that down into the most fundamental roles of a web development team. To help relay this information, let's compare the process of *building your web application* just like the process of *building your house*:

### 1. Design & planning
This is where *creating applications for the internet* starts - with design and planning. Before you - our esteemed coder - ever touches a line of code, there have been countless hours poured into just what this application aims to achieve and how someone can use it with ease. The design & planning phase is where a home building company would work alongside a home buyer to determine how their house will be organized and what features will be offered.

The typicall design & planning process consists of:
1. **Vision casting** - A problem is specified and a team unified in an approach to an initial solution. *"Our client would really like to build a home that has an extra room for their work-from-home office and a 2 car garage."*
2. **Visual design** - Once we've agreed on how to conceptually solve a problem, designer will plan out the interface with visual elements (such as buttons, text fields, images, and text) to create a *design prototype*. *"We have begun the first-draft blueprint for their new home, which considers extra space that can be used for an office and the 2-car garage as requested."*
3. **User testing** - Next, our visual design prototype is handed to potential customers in the real world to see how easy it is to use and gauge how valuable this application will be. Designers will consider the customer's feedback and resolve any points that made usability difficult - such as text being too small to read, or a button click not doing what was expected. *"After consulting with our client, they have decided to reduce the size of the 2-car garage to a 1-car garage. They are happy with the office. Let's move foward with building!*
4. **Design handoff** - Now that we have worked with all necessary parties to finalize our design, we can involve our coders! It seems, simple but this is far more than simply handing off a blueprint - we'll need the engineer's expertise to ensure that the design can be built as is, or make necessary changes if not. It is a good idea to involve engineers early on in the design process. *We have relocated the location of the office after consulting with contractors, and have gained the approval of our buyer. Let's begin building!*

To use our *house building* analogy - designing for the web is comparable to the architecting of your house. In order to orchestrate all of the contractors and builders to ensure your home actually gets built in a timely manner, we must first know exactly what we are building. Just as the web application design process produces a visual design for you to code, the home architecture process will produce a blueprint for contractors to reference.

### 2. Coding & Engineering
### 3. Quality Assurance Testing
Now that you have design & coded out your application, we're done! Right?

NOPE! Though we have achieved the bulk of the work necessary for building our web app, there is still some vital work left to be done. We want to have confidence that once we
