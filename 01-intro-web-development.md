# 1. Intro to Web Development
Welcome to your first lesson! If you're still here, you're still curious. Great! In this lesson, I will expand your curiousity by defining what web development is, why you'd want to do it, and what kind of career you can make out of it.

## What is web development?
***A "Web Developer" is someone who makes applications for the internet***. To get a better idea of what web development is, let's understand the fundamental responsibilities of a web developer:

### Primary Responsibilities of a Web Developer
- Create a user interface from a visual specification given to us by a designer
- Builds processes to allowe am application to incorporate remotely stored information from databases or servers
- Employ best practices to ensure your code is easy to read, efficient, and testable!

### Key Disciplines within Web Development
While the jobs you'll see in the web development industry will vary quite a bit from company to company, let's become familiar with the most basic ones across the board:

* A **Front-end developer** focuses primarily on the *user interface* of an application, or what the user interacts with - such as buttons, text inputs, popup windows, and such. Front-end developers are expected to build the application layout, styling, and interaction according to a designer's visual specification. It is common for a front-end developer to interact with both a visual designer and a back-end developer (described below), acting as a bridge to both creative work and technical work. Because of this unique space between art and math, it may help to think of front-end developers as technical artists. Front-end developers use the standard Web lanuages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

* A **back-end deveoper** will tend to the processing that occurs behind the scenes of the front-end - things like sending, receiving & storing information in a database to be retrieved later on. Though a back-end developer may not contribute directly to the look and feel of an application, they are expected to ensure all "behind-the-scenes" processing occurs without affecting the user's experience with the front-end. There is quite a bit of data operations and logical architecture and rarely any visually creative work done on the back-end. There are too many programming languages to list that a back-end  may be built with, but the most popular are python, ruby, php, java.

* A **full-stack developer** does all of the above! In web development, it is quite common to find someone knowledgeable of the full web development stack, but focus only on the front or back-end.
*
* A **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer** may not necessarily contribute code to an application; instead, a QA engineer's role is to ensure an application can be used according to how the designer has specified. A QA engineer typically uses a combination of manual testing - where they manually use the app - and automated testing - where they will use bots to make it quicker - to ensure an application is in working order. While both front-end and back-end developers will test their code throughout development, a QA engineer is expected to put the application through much more rigorous trials using devices and browsers that the developer may not have access to. A QA engineer can feasibly use any programming language to test an application, but the most popular is JavaScript. It is common for smaller companies who lack a QA engineer position to distribute the burden of testing an application amongst the developers.
 
* A **Developer Operations (DevOps) Engineer**, like a QA engineer, may but isn't required to deliver code for an application. A DevOps engineer will usually manage the 
health and operation of the application to ensure it is ready and accessible to users. A devOps engineer is also expected to work with the rest of the developers to establish and maintain security standards to ensure the protection of both a company's trade secrets as well as a users sensitive information. A devOps engineer also frequently manages the *development pipeline* to guarantee that code can be delivered to an application once it is considered ready. Also similar to a QA engineer, this role is uncommon at smaller companies, who often rely on services offered by Microsoft, Amazon and other companies to manage this development pipeline.

It's alright if these don't quite make sense just yet - as we build out our own application, we're going to act as ALL of these! I'll be sure to highlight As we cross over from one domain into another.
