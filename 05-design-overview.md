# 5. Design Overview ‚úèÔ∏è
Our journey to creating applications for the internet starts with design and planning. Before you - our esteemed coder - ever touches a line of code, there have been countless hours poured into just what this application aims to achieve and how someone can use it with ease. As an engineer, you aren't typically required to be responsible for the design; however, since you will likely work with a designer, it is imperative that you understand the process.

***To help relay this information, let's compare the process of building your web application just like the process of building your house.***

Designing for the web is comparable to the architecting of your house - though nothing is built at this point, there is much planning. In order to orchestrate all of the contractors and builders to ensure your home actually gets built in a timely manner, we must first know exactly what we are building. Just as the web application design process produces a visual design for you to code, the home architecture process will produce a blueprint for contractors to reference.

## The Design Process
The typical design process consists of the following steps:

### 1. Brainstorming
A problem is identified and a team brainstorms an approach.

>*"In their new home, our client would like space for their cars and a home office. that has an extra room for their work-from-home office and a 2 car garage."*

### 2. Visual design
Once we've agreed on how to conceptually solve a problem, designer will plan out the interface with visual elements (such as buttons, text fields, images, and text) to create a design prototype.

>*"We have completed the first-draft blueprint for their new home, which considers extra space that can be used for an office and the 2-car garage as requested."*

### 3. User testing
Next, our visual design prototype is handed to potential customers in the real world to see how easy it is to use and gauge how valuable this application will be. Designers will consider the customer's feedback and resolve any points that made usability difficult - such as text being too small to read, or a button click not doing what was expected.

>*"After consulting with our client, they have decided to reduce the size of the 2-car garage to a 1-car garage. They are happy with the office. Let's move foward with building!*

### 4. Design handoff
Now that we have worked with all necessary parties to finalize our design, we can involve our coders! It seems, simple but this is far more than simply handing off a blueprint - we'll need the engineer's expertise to ensure that the design can be built as is, or make necessary changes if not. It is a good idea to involve engineers early on in the design process.

>*"We have relocated the location of the office after consulting with contractors, and have gained the approval of our buyer. Let's begin building!"*
