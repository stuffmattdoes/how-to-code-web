# 3. Web Fundamentals
If you're still reading, that means you were intrigued by the first two lessons where we discussed what web development is and what it can offer you as a career! Now we will be talking about "Then Web" here for a moment. While this information isn't going to transfer technical mastery to you just yet, it will surely lay the foundation for everything else you will learn through this course.

## What really is "The Web"?
To begin your journey to earning money with web development, let's talk about what "The Web" really is. It is without doubt that you've heard the terms "internet" and "web" before. I'm guessing they're even part of your everyday vernacular, perhaps using "internet" and "web" interchangeably. But can you relay what eachs means techincally and how they differ?

- **The Internet** is the physical network of cables and computers spanning all around the globe, as well as the protocol by which information can travel across it. You can think of the internet as your nervous system, whose layout spans your whole body.
- **The Web** is the software, websites, media, and information itself that travels through the internet. You can think of the web as the signals sent through your nervous system to various parts of your body to ultimately converge in your brain.

"The internet" and "the web" are frequently referred to as one in the same, but indeed they are distinct! Admittedly, I use them interchangeably myself, as you'll see throughout this course. Our job as a web developer isn't to fret over this difference, but to deliver a useful experience to someone in the world.

## How does The Web work?
Let's talk about how the web actually works (in tandem with the internet). To do this, let's investigate what happens between the time you type a URL into a browser and when that same website is finished loading. This is more technically known as **The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Life Cycle**

### The HTTP Life Cycle
2. Client Request (www.github.com)
3. DNS resolves URL to IP address
4. Server receives request
5. Server queries database
6. Server prepares & responds to client request
7. HTTP cycle complete!

## What's the difference between a "website" and a "web app"?

## How do I create an interactive website or application from just coding?

## Overview of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** HTML comprises the *informational* component of our app. 
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** 
- **JavaScript** is where our website's *interactivity* resides. JavaScript can be used to implement nearly any interactive feature you can think of - from something like a popup image gallery to video playback buttons. Technically, CSS is responsible for the layout & apperance of an image gallery or video playback buttons, but JavaScript takes over when you interact - like click or scroll - on these things. Without JavaScript, interactivity with the modern web would be pretty difficult!
